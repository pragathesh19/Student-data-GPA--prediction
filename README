# Student GPA Prediction

This project predicts the Grade Point Average (GPA) of students using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to analyze student-related features and predict their GPA based on academic and behavioral factors.

## Dataset
- Student performance dataset
- Features include study time, attendance, and other academic parameters

Note: The dataset is not uploaded due to file size limitations.

## Methodology
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train a regression model
4. Evaluate model performance using R² score
5. Predict GPA for new inputs

## Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Result
The model was able to predict student GPA with reasonable accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict academic performance.
